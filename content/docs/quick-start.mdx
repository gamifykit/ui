GamifyKit is a collection of components built on top of shadcn/ui. This guide will help you get started with adding these components to your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a working project with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) installed.

1. **Next.js** project set up.
2. **Tailwind CSS** configured.
3. **shadcn/ui** initialized in your project.

## Installation

You can add components to your project using the shadcn/ui CLI. For example, to add a GamifyKit component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @gamifykit/<<component-name>>
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install components manually:

1. Create a new file in your `components/ui` directory (e.g., `<<component_name>>.tsx`).
2. Copy the source code for the component from the documentation.
3. Install any required dependencies (usually listed in the component's registry item or documentation).

## Usage

Once installed, you can import and use the component in your React application just like any other React components.
Refer to the component's documentation for usage examples and API reference.

## Next Steps

Now that you've got the basics down, you can:
