GamifyKit is a collection of components built on top of shadcn/ui. This guide will help you get started with adding these components to your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a working project with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) installed.

1. **Next.js** project set up.
2. **Tailwind CSS** configured.
3. **shadcn/ui** initialized in your project.

## Installation

You can add components to your project using the shadcn/ui CLI. For example, to add the `achievements` component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://gamifykit.com/r/achievements.json
```

Or if you've already added GamifyKit as a remote:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @gamifykit/achievements
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install components manually:

1. Create a new file in your `components/ui` directory (e.g., `achievements.tsx`).
2. Copy the source code for the component from the documentation.
3. Install any required dependencies (usually listed in the component's registry item or documentation).

## Usage

Once installed, you can import and use the component in your React application:

```tsx
import { Achievements } from "@/components/ui/achievements";
import { Zap, Trophy } from "lucide-react";

export default function MyPage() {
  const achievements = [
    {
      id: "1",
      title: "First Steps",
      description: "Complete your first daily task",
      icon: <Zap fill="currentColor" className="h-6 w-6" />,
      badgeClassName: "bg-yellow-500 border-yellow-500 text-white",
      unlockedAt: new Date(),
    },
    {
      id: "2",
      title: "Consistency King",
      description: "Maintain a 7-day streak",
      icon: <Trophy className="h-6 w-6" />,
      progress: 3,
      total: 7,
      isLocked: true,
    },
  ];

  return (
    <Achievements
      title="My Achievements"
      description="Track your progress and unlock rewards"
      achievements={achievements}
      className="max-w-md"
    />
  );
}
```
